# TacViewInterpreter

This is a quick and dirty solution to read TacView Flightlog files and sort them.
It will create a .txt and a .xls file containing all casualties caused by weapons. The casualties are sorted by type (aircraft, SAM, tanks, etc.) and grouped by country.

TODO:
1. Add losses not caused by weapons
2. Add information about weapons used
