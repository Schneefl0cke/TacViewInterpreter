# TacViewInterpreter

This programs aims to generate statistics about your DCS mission.
To use it, you need TacView and export the flight log.
The programm will create a .xls file containing all KIA caused by weapons, and MIA (accidents). The casualties are sorted by type (aircraft, SAM, tanks, etc.) and grouped by country. Things killed by players and players killed are also listed.

I will not make a highscore list about which player killed the most or K/D ratios. My flying philosophy is, that the mission comes always first, going home second and kills last.
