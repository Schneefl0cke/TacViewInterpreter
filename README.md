# TacViewInterpreter

This is a quick and dirty solution to read TacView Flightlog files and sort them.
It will create a .txt and a .xls file containing all casualties caused by weapons. The casualties are sorted by type (aircraft, SAM, tanks, etc.) and grouped by country.

The created .txt files can be added together to generate a new report, so you can keep track of the losses in a campaign.

TODO:
1. Add losses not caused by weapons
2. Add information about weapons used
